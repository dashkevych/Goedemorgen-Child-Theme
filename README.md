# Goedemorgen Child Theme

The Goedemorgen Child Theme is a starter blank child theme for WordPress Goedemorgen theme.

## Renaming *(optional)*

You can rename the **zip** file of the child theme, so it is not called *goedemorgen-child-master.zip*. It's better to have a folder that is called **goedemorgen-child** rather than **goedemorgen-child-master**. It makes more sense :)

1. Download the child theme from it's GitHub Repository.
1. Navigate to WordPress > Appearance > Themes > Add New.
1. Click **Upload Theme** and **Choose Fil**e, then select the theme's .zip file. Click **Install Now**.
